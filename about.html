              It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects
            </p>
            <p>
              To be honest, nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to
              manage their project. Using GitHub is free if your project is
              open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it
              easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback
              about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a
              project, make your changes and then send them a pull request
              using GitHub web interface.

            <p class="heading">Documentation</p>
            <p>
              By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent
              documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for
              nearly any topic related to git that you can think of.

            <p>
              Are you a developer and wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is
              the best tool you can rely on for this. Today, when searching
              for new recruits for their project, most companies look into the
              GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a
              higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a
              great university or college.

            <p class="heading">Markdown</p>
            <p>
              Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write
              formatted documents. GitHub has revolutionized writing by
              channeling everything through Markdown: from the issue tracker,
              user comments, everything. With so many other programming
              languages to learn for setting up projects, it’s really a big
              benefit to have your content inputted in a format without having
              to learn yet another system.

            <p class="heading">GitHub is a repository</p>
            <p>
              This was already mentioned before, but it’s important to note,
              GitHub is a repository. What this means that it allows your work
              to get out there in front of the public. Moreover, GitHub is one
              of the largest coding communities around right now, so it’s wide
              exposure for your project.

            <p class="heading">Track changes in your code across versions</p>
            <p>
              When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep
              track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files
              are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track
              of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository. Much
              like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a
              version history of your code so that previous versions are not
              lost with every iteration.

            <p class="heading">Integration options</p>
            <p>
              GitHub can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and
              Google Cloud, services such as Code Climate to track your
              feedback, and can highlight syntax in over 200 different
              programming languages.
